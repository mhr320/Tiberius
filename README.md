A solar panel powered monitoring system.

Particle Photon WiFi MCU
Texas Instruments IN219 Current Sensor

control status LEDs connected to Photon

read logged current/voltage files from SD card connected to Photon

plot logged current/voltage values (maybe with matplotlib python library)

calculate total power generated

display total statistics of power generation of time

anything else our imaginations can devise
